# PicoPiTender
Replacement for PiTender using picoW and PC over the unobtainable raspberry pi zero w



If we rplace the Pi Zero W with the Pico W we can create a PiTender that is buildible since we cant buy a Pi Zer anywhere for a resonable price.
I thought it would be simple to convert the code over to some other platform in python and have that run the app and sent the commands to the pico to actually control the pumps.  


At lest that is what I am going to attempt here.

Also I am going to add a ULN2803 to convert the 3.3 voltsd to 5 volts so we can run the reelay board more reliably at 5volts.  there is a  lot of confusion around driving the relay board from any 3.3 volt device. 

Schematics and code to follow. Soon.
